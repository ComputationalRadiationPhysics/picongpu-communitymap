## Contribute

If you are or did use PIConGPU in your work, please consider adding yourself.
PIConGPU comes without a registration-wall, without strings attached and without any feedback to us (if you do not decide to).

That means **we rely on you** to show our community, diversity and usefulness, e.g. to funding agencies!

One important way to give back to the PIConGPU community is by [properly citing PIConGPU in your works](https://picongpu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/reference.html).

An other one is to [add yourself to this map](https://github.com/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/picongpu-communitymap/issues/new)!
