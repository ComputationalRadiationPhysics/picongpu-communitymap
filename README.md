## Contribute

If you are or did use PIConGPU in your work, research, studies, benchmarks, ... or publications, please consider adding yourself.

PIConGPU comes without a registration-wall, with open and re-distributable licenses, without strings attached.
Due to all that freedom...: if you do not decide to provide feedback to us we will not know that you are using PIConGPU.

**That means _we rely on you_ to show our community, diversity and usefulness, e.g. to funding agencies!**

One important way to give back to the PIConGPU community is by [properly citing PIConGPU in your works](https://picongpu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/reference.html).

Another one is to [add yourself to our map](https://github.com/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/picongpu-communitymap/issues/new)!
